Structure
---------

  index.php      controller
  functions.php  common functions
  setup.php      configuration

  views/         views
    list.php     directory, thumbnail list
    view.php     picture details
    image.php    image loader

  templates/     PHP + XHTML template files


Control Flow
------------

Scry has three views:

  list   renders a listing of subdirectories and image thumbnails in the
         current directory with optional pagination

  view   renders a single image with links to previous and next

  image  loads and resizes the target image, optionally caching to disk

index.php is the controller.  The view is selected based on the URL as
described below.  index.php sets up any global variables and then
delegates control to the view.


Security
--------

All filesystem calls (reads, writes, and Scry functions) are marked
with "FS [TYPE]".  Each file also contains a security header comment
denoting critical path variables.  These variables are scrubbed and
tested via the path_security_check function, verifying the resolved
paths (actual path when considering multiple slashes, ., and ..) are
within the configured image paths.

If $CFG_resize_external is set, scry will attempt to use this as an
external command for resizing images.  Before executing this command,
Scry scrubs it to remove shell metacharacters.  This feature is
purely optional and the exec call is marked with EXEC.

Scry does not use any PHP network functions.


Variables
---------

Configuration variables are all contained in setup.php and prefixed
with 'CFG'.

Scry assumes that register_globals is off, and references only the
$_SERVER and $_GET superglobals.


URLs
----

Scry can operate in two variable modes, "get" and "path", as set by
$CFG_variable_mode.

In GET mode, the controller parses three variables for use by the
views:

  name     description     value
  -----    ------------    ------
  i        index           integer offset or image size WxH
  p        path            [relative path to image]
  v        view            (list|view|image)

A get mode URL might look like:

  http://[server]/[scry_path]/index.php?v=[view]&i=[index]&p=[image_path]

Path mode uses slash-separated values instead of HTTP GET values.  This
mode offers a cleaner URL layout - at least aesthetically.

  http://[server]/[scry_path]/index.php/[view]/[index]/[image_path]

Path mode requires either Apache 1.3 or Apache 2.0 with the
AcceptPathInfo directive set to On in httpd.conf or .htaccess.
Because of this restriction, Scry defaults to get mode.

Examples:

  list   http://[server]/photos/index.php?a=list&i=2&p=/path/to/images/
         http://[server]/photos/index.php/list/2/path/to/images/

  view   http://[server]/photos/index.php?a=view&i=12&p=/path/to/images/00024601.jpg
         http://[server]/photos/index.php/view/12/path/to/images/00024601.jpg

  image  http://[server]/photos/index.php?a=image&i=800x600&p=path/to/images/00024601.jpg
         http://[server]/photos/index.php/image/800x600/path/to/images/00024601.jpg


Global Variables
----------------

  name             description
  ----             -----------
  T                template variable array
  VIEW             view name
  INDEX            index variable (offset or image dimension)
  IMAGE_FILE       image filename ('IMG20040201.jpg')
  IMAGE_DIR        image directory under $CFG_path_images ('Family/2003')
  PATH             full filesystem path to directory / image
  PATH_BASEDIR     filesystem path to directory / image without filename


Caching
-------

If $CFG_cache_enable is true, Scry will cache resized images.

Caching is highly recommended.  If caching is off, or if you are
viewing the page for the first time, the page will render at a speed
proprotional to the processing speed of your webserver and the number
of images on the page.

Only two sizes of images will be cached: thumbnail size or view size,
as set by $CFG_thumb_(width|height) and $CFG_view_(width|height).


Images Outside Docroot
----------------------

By default, Scry sends Location: headers to the browser to load cached
images directly from the cache directory within the webserver's
docroot.  However, both the cache directory and the image directory
can be located outside the docroot if desired.  In this case, Scry
will pass image loads through readfile() in the image.php view.

See README for instructions on how to set up images outside the
docroot.


Resizing
--------

Scry attempts to intelligently resize images for thumbnails and
viewing, based on the bounds set by $CFG_thumb_(width|height) and
$CFG_image_(width|height).  Resized images will maintain their original
aspect ratio but will not exceed the bounds above.


Templates
---------

Templates are simple XHTML files with <?php ?> looping, control, and
variable blocks.  'default' is a good example of the variables Scry
provides.  Note that templates should only refer to variables in the
$T global.


Debugging
---------

There are two methods for debugging Scry.  The first is to use the
'debug' template by changing $CFG_path_template and $CFG_url_template
variables to point to 'debug' instead of 'default'.  This template dumps
the value of all Scry variables.  You can navigate through the views
but the debug template will not display images.

To debug images.php, set the $CFG_debug_image variable to true.  The
image view will print text debugging output.  Note that if this flag
is set, images in other views will appear to be broken unless you load
the image view directly.
